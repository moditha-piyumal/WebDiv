    <h3>Putin's Puppet, Destroyer of Democracies, Master Propagandist, Promoter of Tyranny, Evil Incarnate!</h3>

    <h4>John Joseph Mearsheimer, born December 14, 1947) is an American political scientist and international relations scholar, who belongs to the realist school of thought. He is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago. He has been described as the most influential realist of his generation.

    Mearsheimer is best known for developing the theory of offensive realism, which describes the interaction between great powers as being primarily driven by the rational desire to achieve regional hegemony in an anarchic international system.</h4>

        Career
    </h2>
    <p>
        Since 1982, Mearsheimer has been a member of the faculty of the Department of Political Science Faculty at the
        University of Chicago.[7] He became an associate professor in 1984 and a full professor in 1987 and was appointed the R.
        Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in 1996. From 1989 to 1992, he served as chairman of the department. He
        also holds a position as a faculty member in the Committee on International Relations graduate program, and he is a
        co-director of the Program on International Security Policy.<br><br>
        
        Mearsheimer's books include Conventional Deterrence (1983), which won the Edgar S. Furniss Jr. Book Award; Nuclear
        Deterrence: Ethics and Strategy (co-editor, 1985); Liddell Hart and the Weight of History (1988); The Tragedy of Great
        Power Politics (2001), which won the Lepgold Book Prize; The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy (2007); and Why
        Leaders Lie: The Truth About Lying in International Politics (2011). His articles have appeared in academic journals
        like International Security and popular magazines like the London Review of Books. He has written op-ed pieces for The
        New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and the Chicago Tribune.<br><br>
        
        Mearsheimer has won several teaching awards. He received the Clark Award for Distinguished Teaching when he was a
        graduate student at Cornell in 1977, and he won the Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching at the
        University of Chicago in 1985. In addition, he was selected as a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar for the 1993â€“1994
        academic year. In that capacity, he gave a series of talks at eight colleges and universities. In 2003, he was elected
        to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is the recipient of the American Political Science Association's 2020
        James Madison Award, which is presented every three years to an American political scientist who has made distinguished
        scholarly contributions. The Award Committee noted that Mearsheimer is "one of the most cited International Relations
        scholars in the discipline, but his works are read well beyond the academy as well."<br><br>
        
        Mearsheimer's works are widely read and debated[according to whom?] by 21st century students of international relations.
        A 2017 survey of U.S. international relations faculty ranks him third among "scholars whose work has had the greatest
        influence on the field of IR in the past 20 years."
