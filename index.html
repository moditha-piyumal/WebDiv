        <h1>Description of the Daily Accomplishments</h1>

        <section id="day01" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 01</h3>
            <p>I was able to revise what I know about HTML by going through the Udemy course of Angela. Her part on HTML was not very exhaustive and I simply knew a lot more. But, I wanted to start easy and it was a feel good revision day. I also made a small page in HTML following Angela's guidance. But, I clearly did not need any help in handling HTML or CSS.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day02" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 02</h3>
            <p>I designed the grid that I needed to make the home page of my coding journal website. It took a lot of adjustments. The CSS animations were combined with the grid. Anyway, at the end, I was not disappointed.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day03" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 03</h3>
            <p>I added more parts to the home page that I designed. I further went through the Udemy course of Angela. This time the progress was a bit slow. But, there were not that many things I needed to know. I also re-watched certain flexbox and css grid videos. There I learned some new things about making certain really good looking grid designs.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day04" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 04</h3>
            <p>I completed the portfolio home page. Now I am set to update my daily tasks and link everything I do to learn coding. This took a while because of a tough translating week. But, from now on, translations will take a second place in my life. I will definitely make it in coding.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day05" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 05</h3>
            <p>I made the CSS Page of Angela's Course. I was able to easily design it. It was a bit more of a challenge to make the Government Information Site using Bootstrap after finishing the Bootstrap lessons with Angela. Angela's videos on Bootstrap were very good. But, I think I still like Tailwind.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day06" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 06</h3>
            <p>I made an Asatru Web Page. The Original Page was in a poor condition and I made it look better. It was a good experience. I must try to make such pages. Unlike certain difficult tasks, making web pages is not tedious. It is an enjoyable line of work.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day07" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 07</h3>
            <p>I was able to make a video home page with Traversy. The video site was awesome. I learned a lot although I spent too much time getting stuck. I think I am going to make such a home page as a home page for all my minor javascript projects, which I believe there will be many. I had to go to funeral. So, the time I had was limited. Anyway, designing studies were done. I finished the Udemy Course Sections on Design.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day08" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 08</h3>
            <p>I completed all the projects on the design sections of the Udemy course on CSS. I was good at CSS anyway and this time I was able to grasp Bootstrap far better than I did before. I was able to create a good sites with bootstrap and I am leaving some parts to be done in the future when I get bored and moving on to the JS part.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day09" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 09</h3>
            <p>I completed many javascript lessons and moved closer to finishing up revision. I was able to understand IF statements far better than I did last time and I was able to very successfully complete the earlier parts of the Udemy course and all the necessary exercises.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day10" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 10</h3>
            <p>I could understand FOR loops and WHILE loops far better than I did the first time I studied tham. I was able to study and finish the exercises without making a mess. This was really good for my confidence. I am on the right track. Revision of all the javascript lessons ends today.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day11" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 11</h3>
            <p>I was able to study the DOM manipulations regarding JS and I could quickly move from lesson to lesson because I understood the concept well. I have studied this before, but, the memory was vague and I was able to understand the concept more fully. I also made some good notes which can help me get through certain exercises if I have to study more in the future.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day12" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 12</h3>
            <p>I made a Dice Game which was a challenge in the App Brewary Course. I was able to complete it without much trouble. I also started using chatGPT to help myself code better. It seems that chatGPT can be really helpful. Although people say that it will kill jobs, it is extremely difficult for a non-programmer to understand anything it says. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="day13" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 13</h3>
            <p>I made a Drum Kit with the help of Angela Yu. It was a nice challenge and I did not mess up a lot. I had to refer to the answers a bit. But, it seemed easy. I believe the part where I cannot figure out what kind of an disaster is going on is over. I still mess up my code. But, I can at least find out what went wrong.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day14" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 14</h3>
            <p>I learned JQuery. It wasn't that hard and I did not learn extensively. I had to attend a wedding and therefore did not spend the entire day coding. JQuery seems helpful. But, I am going to study React more.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day15" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 15</h3>
            <p>The Boss Level Challenge of the Simon Game was tough. I did try my best to come up with my own solutions. Sometimes I did manage. Sometimes I had to check the answer. I did several codewars challenges as well. It was a great day. I can solve codewars challenges with the help of chatGPT and Google. I can understand when things go wrong. I can feel that I have levelled up. I am not where I must be. But, I am getting there.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day16" class="daysec">
            <h3>Day 16</h3>
            <p>Today, I learned Unix Command Line.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="day17" class="daysec">
